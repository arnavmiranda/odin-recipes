        </h2>
        <p>
            <em>This crockpot mac and cheese is creamy, comforting, and takes just moments to assemble in a slow cooker. Great for large family gatherings and to take to potluck dinners. It's always a big hit!</em>

            “This is an outstanding staple recipe,” raves Michelle Allen. “It's the closest consistency and flavor to my mother-in-law's legendary homemade mac n cheese. I make it often for large gatherings and get requests for the recipe all the time.”

            “Very easy recipe,” says one Allrecipes community member. “I can’t find the cheese soup in my area so I used a small block of Velveeta. Really creamy and tasty comfort food.”

            “Every time I make this for a party I get rave reviews and it is all gone even with a double batch (two crockpots)" says Kelly. "I love that you can make it and forget it and go about your day. I never cook the pasta first, I also put it into the crockpot dry. My family likes their mac and cheese dryer rather than soupy. Anyway that is the only change I make. It comes out great!"
