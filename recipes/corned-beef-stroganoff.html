        <p>
            <em>This corned beef stroganoff, with mushrooms, creme fraiche, and dill, is a switch from the classic St. Patrick's Day preparation. The result is amazing—it really does taste like a proper stroganoff, but even more flavorful.</em>

            "Made this yesterday and served it over egg noodles. It was really good! I used sour creme since I didn't have creme fraiche. If you end up using sour cream, make sure to temper it so it won't clot."

            "My house smells like corned beef and I love it. I forgot creme friache but have ricotta."

            2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

        </li>
        <li>
            2 cups low-sodium beef broth
        </li>

            3/4 cup creme fraiche, plus more for garnish

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>

        <li>
            Place corned beef along with the contents of spice packet into a pot, and cover by 2 inches with water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 2 hours 15 minutes. While corned beef is cooking, occasionally add more water to keep the level near where it was when it started boiling. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove corned beef to a bowl, and let cool until cool enough to handle, at least 30 minutes. Reserve 1 cup cooking liquid.
        </li>
        <li>
            When meat is cool, slice off most of the fat. Cut meat with the grain into thick strips, and then turn and slice into thin, bite-sized pieces. Reserve until needed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and salt to the hot pan, and cook and stir until mushrooms are nicely browned, about 3 minutes. Add onions, and continue cooking until they soften and turn translucent, about 3 minutes. Add butter and stir until melted.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make a space in the center of the pan, add garlic, and sauté until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add flour, and cook and stir for 1 minute more. Pour in white wine and reserved corned beef cooking liquid, and stir to combine. Raise the heat to high, bring to a boil, and cook, stirring, until sauce reduces by about half and thickens, 3 to 5 minutes more.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in beef broth, and continue to boil and reduce until sauce thickens again, 6 to 7 minutes. Stir in crème fraiche, and reduce until the sauce is as thick as you’d like, a few more minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in sliced corned beef, and reduce heat to medium-low. Cook, stirring occasionally, until meat is heated through, 2 to 4 minutes. Sprinkle with fresh dill.
        </li>
        <li>
            Garnish each serving with a small dollop of crème fraiche or sour cream and a little fresh dill.
