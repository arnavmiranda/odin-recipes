        <p>
            <em>Make chicken enchilada soup in your crockpot for a tasty, hot meal! We like to top each bowl with crushed corn tortilla chips, shredded cheese, or chopped green onions — and sometimes all three.</em>

            "I used this recipe but i substituted the chicken for lean ground turkey, added 1 can 14.5oz. of red kidney beans and instead of using enchilada sauce i used 8 oz. of mild salsa and it tasted so good."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Great taste! I added a can of black beans and used frozen corn, otherwise followed the recipe as is. Will make this again!"
        </p>
        <p>
            "I have been making this for a while and this is the best chicken (tortilla soup) recipe I have found. I have made adjustments and added 1 can black beans (rinsed) and 2 TBSP dry ranch dressing mix and 1 can Rotel. AMAZING."
